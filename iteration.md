# Potential Claude Spaces Applications

This document collects ideas for how the Claude Spaces pattern could be applied to various domains beyond system administration.

## Ingredients: Building Blocks for Claude Spaces

Each Claude Space can incorporate these elements to bring the skeleton structure to life:

| Ingredient | Purpose | Implementation |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| **Context** | Organized context data / lightweight repo-level RAG | Structured directories containing domain-specific information, documentation, and reference materials that Claude can access |
| **System Prompts** | Careful context ingestion and behavioral guidance | `CLAUDE.md` at repository root with nested versions (e.g., `/context/CLAUDE.md`, `/subdirectory/CLAUDE.md`) for hierarchical context control |
| **Slash Commands** | Streamline recurrent tasks | Custom commands (e.g., `/budget-report`, `/track-milestone`, `/generate-summary`) for frequently repeated workflows specific to the space |
| **MCP Servers** | Connect to external tools and data sources | Model Context Protocol integrations for APIs, databases, external services relevant to the domain (e.g., finance APIs, project management tools, health tracking services) |

These ingredients combine to create a workspace with:
- Persistent, domain-specific knowledge
- Consistent AI behavior tailored to the use case
- Efficient workflows for common operations
- Integration with external systems and data

## Pattern Characteristics

The core pattern across all these examples: **using repository/folder structure to tightly modularize project context and data for non-traditional code development use cases**.

Each potential Claude Space would share these characteristics:
- **Repository-based organization**: Leverages version control and folder structure for context management, not code editing
- **Domain-specific context**: Accumulated knowledge relevant to the specific workflow
- **Historical continuity**: Record of past decisions, actions, and outcomes
- **Iterative refinement**: Documentation and processes that improve with use
- **Reproducible workflows**: Established patterns for recurring tasks
- **Consolidated resources**: Relevant tools, references, and materials in one workspace
- **Non-development focus**: These are operational, creative, or administrative workspaces—not software development projects

## Common Benefits

Across domains, Claude Spaces could provide:
- Reduced cognitive load by maintaining context between sessions
- Better documentation as a natural byproduct of work
- More consistent approaches to recurring tasks
- Accumulated learning that improves over time
- Single source of truth for domain-specific work
