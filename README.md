An index of Claude Code workspace repositories used for system administration tasks. This documents a pattern I've identified and implemented for using Claude Code beyond traditional software development.

> **Note**: "Claude Spaces" is my own terminology, not official Anthropic terminology.

## What Are Claude Spaces?

Claude Spaces are Claude Code workspaces structured as repositories, where the primary use case is **not traditional code development or editing**. Instead, they leverage repository/folder structure to tightly modularize project context and data for operational, administrative, or creative workflows.

The pattern involves organizing workspaces around specific domains (desktop management, network administration, content creation, etc.) rather than software projects. This approach adapts version control and workspace organization for non-development use cases.

Each workspace typically includes:
- **Context**: Domain-specific information and configurations
- **Memory**: Historical interactions and learned patterns
- **History**: Documentation of actions and decisions

## Repository Index

This repository catalogs Claude Spaces I've created, organized into two categories:

### 1. Local System Administration

![Local Admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Local%20Admin-blue.svg)

Workspaces for administering local computers (developed for Linux desktops).

#### General Purpose Local Admin

#### Task-Specific Local Admin

| Repository | Task Type | Description |

| [Claude Code Security Auditor](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Security-Auditor) | ![Security](https://img.shields.io/badge/Task-Security-red.svg) | Security auditing workspace |

### 2. Remote System Administration

![Remote Admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Remote%20Admin-blueviolet.svg)

Workspaces for administering devices on local networks or remote systems over SSH.

| Repository | Protocol/Scope | Description |
|------------|----------------|-------------|
| [Claude Code Remote Machine Admin Space](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-Remote-Machine-Admin-Space) | ![SSH](https://img.shields.io/badge/Protocol-SSH-lightblue.svg) | Individual remote system administration |
| [Claude Code LAN Manager](https://github.com/danielrosehill/Claude-Code-LAN-Manager) | ![LAN](https://img.shields.io/badge/Scope-LAN-lightblue.svg) | Homelab and collective remote management |

## Use Cases

Current implementations use Claude Code for:
- System configuration and optimization
- Package and dependency management
- Network administration
- Security auditing and hardening
- Environment setup and maintenance
- Multi-system orchestration
- Infrastructure documentation

## Potential Applications

![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-conceptual-yellow.svg)

The pattern could extend to other domains beyond system administration. The approach of maintaining persistent context, history, and system prompts in workspace repositories could apply to various operational workflows.

See [iteration.md](iteration.md) for a comprehensive list of potential applications across content creation, research, business operations, education, and more.

## Pattern Characteristics

The defining characteristic: **using repository/folder structure to tightly modularize project context and data for non-traditional code development use cases**.

This approach adapts Claude Code for operational, administrative, and creative tasks by maintaining persistent workspaces with:
- Repository-based organization leveraging version control for context management
- Accumulated context specific to the domain
- Historical records of actions and decisions
- System prompts tailored to the workflow
- Documentation that evolves with use

The pattern makes complex operational tasks more repeatable and better documented by treating them as ongoing collaborative processes rather than isolated sessionsâ€”all within the familiar structure of a repository, but without the focus on code editing or software development.
