An index of Claude Code workspace repositories used for system administration tasks. This documents a pattern I've identified and implemented for using Claude Code beyond traditional software development.

> **Note**: "Claude Spaces" is my own terminology, not official Anthropic terminology.

## What Are Claude Spaces?

Claude Spaces are Claude Code workspaces structured as repositories, where the primary use case is **not traditional code development or editing**. Instead, they leverage repository/folder structure to tightly modularize project context and data for operational, administrative, or creative workflows.

The pattern involves organizing workspaces around specific domains (desktop management, network administration, content creation, etc.) rather than software projects. This approach adapts version control and workspace organization for non-development use cases.

Each workspace typically includes:
- **Context**: Domain-specific information and configurations
- **Memory**: Historical interactions and learned patterns
- **History**: Documentation of actions and decisions

## Repository Index

This repository catalogs Claude Spaces I've created, organized into two categories:

### 1. Local System Administration

![Local Admin](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-Local%20Admin-blue.svg)

Workspaces for administering local computers (developed for Linux desktops).

## Use Cases

Current implementations use Claude Code for:
- System configuration and optimization
- Package and dependency management
- Network administration
- Security auditing and hardening
- Environment setup and maintenance
- Multi-system orchestration
- Infrastructure documentation

## Potential Applications

![Coming Soon](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-conceptual-yellow.svg)

The pattern could extend to other domains beyond system administration. The approach of maintaining persistent context, history, and system prompts in workspace repositories could apply to various operational workflows.

See [iteration.md](iteration.md) for a comprehensive list of potential applications across content creation, research, business operations, education, and more.

Any domain involving systematic workflows and accumulated context could potentially benefit from this workspace pattern.

## Pattern Characteristics

The defining characteristic: **using repository/folder structure to tightly modularize project context and data for non-traditional code development use cases**.

This approach adapts Claude Code for operational, administrative, and creative tasks by maintaining persistent workspaces with:
- Repository-based organization leveraging version control for context management
- Accumulated context specific to the domain
- Historical records of actions and decisions
- System prompts tailored to the workflow
- Documentation that evolves with use

The pattern makes complex operational tasks more repeatable and better documented by treating them as ongoing collaborative processes rather than isolated sessionsâ€”all within the familiar structure of a repository, but without the focus on code editing or software development.

## Implementation Agnostic Pattern

While this repository demonstrates the pattern using **Claude Code**, this is fundamentally an **AI agent CLI + repository pattern** that can be implemented with any AI agent wrapper or CLI tool.

### Why This Pattern Works

The core insight is that **modularizing context, history, MCP servers, and configurations into dedicated repositories** provides significant benefits for non-development tasks:

- **Context Persistence**: Repository structure maintains domain-specific context across sessions
- **History Tracking**: Version control naturally documents the evolution of configurations and decisions
- **Modular Configuration**: Each workspace can have tailored system prompts, slash commands, and MCP servers
- **Reproducibility**: Workspace repositories can be cloned, shared, or restored
- **Organization**: Clear separation of concerns across different operational domains

### Alternative Implementations

This pattern could equally be implemented with:

- **Qwen CLI/Wrapper**: Using Qwen's command-line interface with repository-based workspaces
- **Goose**: Duck AI's agent system with folder-based context management
- **Codex Wrappers**: OpenAI Codex CLIs with persistent workspace configurations
- **Aider**: AI pair programming tool with project-specific context
- **Continue**: VS Code extension with workspace-level customization
- **Custom Agent Implementations**: Any AI agent system that can work with file-based context and configuration

### Core Requirements

Any AI agent CLI can adopt this pattern if it supports:
1. **Working Directory Context**: Ability to operate within a specific folder/repository
2. **Configuration Files**: Support for workspace-specific settings (e.g., CLAUDE.md, system prompts, slash commands)
3. **Persistent Memory**: Mechanism to maintain context across sessions (files, databases, etc.)
4. **Tool/MCP Integration**: Extensibility through plugins, tools, or Model Context Protocol servers

The specific implementation (Claude Code, Qwen, Goose, etc.) is simply the **execution layer**â€”the real value comes from the **repository-based modularization** of operational workflows.

This repository documents my implementation using Claude Code, but the underlying pattern is tool-agnostic and represents a broader approach to AI-assisted operational work.
